    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, 
      rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, 
      in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
